# Exploratory Analysis of 311 Data Using Python

This is an exploratory analysis of 311 data in New York City with a focus on two Brooklyn zip codes: 11201, where I went to school at NYU's Center for Urban Science and Progress, and 11216, where I lived while attending school.

This folder includes the iPython Notebook used for this analysis and a slide presentation with the results. The presentation includes recommendations for NYC's Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) and other city leaders.
